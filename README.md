This tool implements the SCC-based simplifications of acceptance condition formulae for transition-based Emerson-Lei automata (TELA) that I proposed in my bachelor's thesis. These simplifications aim to reduce the number of unique acceptance sets of the automaton and possibly reduce the length of the acceptance formula.
