\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Introduction}

Our society has become heavily reliant on computer systems in order to function. Unexpected behavior of software often results merely in minor inconvenience, however is some cases it might pose a threat to human safety. Therefore it is crucial to have the ability to verify if the properties of software in question behave as intended. 

One such verification method is model-checking. The basic idea of this method is using finite state automata to accurately describe the current state of given program at any time during its execution. The states of the automaton TODO: and the transitions between them describe how specific events shift the state of the program from one to another. To be able to describe programs which should never terminate, we use $\omega-$automata -- finite automata on infinite words. During the process of model-checking a product of two automata is created. It is desirable to have as small product as possible which can be achieved by applying reduction methods to the original automata.

\section{Structure of the thesis}
This thesis is structured into several chapter. Chapter two contains the basic definitions of constructs used throughout the thesis. %TODO: 

\chapter{Basic definitions}
\section{Transition-based Emerson-Lei Automaton (TELA)} %je skarede mit to v zavorce?
A transition-based Emerson-Lei automaton, shortly TELA, is a tuple $\mathcal{A} = (\Sigma, Q, q_0, \delta, Acc)$, where
\begin{itemize}
  \item $\Sigma$ is an alphabet,
  \item $Q$ is a finite set of states,
  \item $q_0 \in Q$ is the initial state,
  \item $\delta \subseteq Q \times \Sigma \times Q$ is a transition relation,
  \item $Acc$ is a Boolean formula over terms of the form $Fin(T)$ or $Inf(T)$ for any subset $T \subseteq \delta$. %positive Boolean function 
\end{itemize}

For a transition $t = (t^s, t^l, t^d) \in \delta$, $t^s$ denotes its source, $t^l$ its label and $t^d$ its destination.
