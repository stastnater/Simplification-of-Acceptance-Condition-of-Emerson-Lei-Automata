abstract="Recently, there was defined a fragment of LTL (containing fairness properties among other interesting formulae) whose validity over a given infinite word depends only on an arbitrary suffix of the word. Building upon an existing translation from LTL to B{\"u}chi automata, we introduce a compositional approach where subformulae of this fragment are translated separately from the rest of an input formula and the produced automata are composed in a way that the subformulae are checked only in relevant accepting strongly connected components of the final automaton. Further, we suggest improvements over some procedures commonly applied to generalized B{\"u}chi automata, namely over generalized acceptance simplification and over degeneralization. Finally we show how existing simulation-based reductions can be implemented in a signature-based framework in a way that improves the determinism of the automaton.",
